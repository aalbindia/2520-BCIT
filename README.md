My first commit for an academic class.
- Throughout college I will do my best to commit code that I've worked on, either academic or not into Github.
- This will allow me to practice using external tools/ terminal commands to share and display my code


Specifically for this course 2520: Developing Applications, this repository will only contain code from the course.
